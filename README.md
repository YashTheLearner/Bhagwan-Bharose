## What C2Three Does

C2Three converts standard medical CT scan slices into **detailed, interactive 3D render** that can be explored in real time.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of 2D slices hoping, clinicians and patients get a complete spatial picture of the body — rotatable, sliceable, and annotated.

                   Reconstruction       Detection        Validation
```

### Core Capabilities

**3D Reconstruction Engine**
Our algorithm processes scans by dividing them into anatomical layers — muscle,bone vasculature — and reconstructs them into a coherent 3D render. Each structure is color-mapped for instant spatial orientation.

**Interactive Viewer**
- Rotate, zoom, and slice through the model in real time
- Explore layer by layer: toggle muscle, bone, nerves independently
- Color-coded anatomical landmarks for instant visual clarity

**Technical Approach**
The most critical metadata CT scan includes are - PixelSpacing and SliceThickness for spatial resolution, ImagePositionPatient and ImageOrientationPatient for geometric alignment, and RescaleSlope/Intercept for converting raw pixel values into Hounsfield Units used in segmentation. Meta data from dicom files is extracted to generate layers of the model.

**Conversational Interface**
Ask questions about your scan in plain language. Get context-aware responses grounded in the 3D model currently on screen.

**Connect with a Real Doctor**
AI findings can be sent directly to verified specialist physicians who review the results, validate findings, and provide professional medical advice.

## Why It's Different

### The Problem With Existing Tools

| Tool Category | What They Do | What They Miss |
|---|---|---|
| PACS / Radiology Workstations | Professional DICOM viewing | Requires specialist training; expensive; no AI |
| Consumer Health Apps | Basic health tracking | No imaging analysis whatsoever |
| Research Viewers (3D Slicer, OsiriX) | Powerful 3D reconstruction | Not accessible to non-experts; steep learning curve |
| Generic AI Diagnostic Tools | Pattern detection on 2D images | No 3D context; no interactive exploration |

**C2Three sits in the gap**: accessible enough for a patient or a junior clinician, powerful enough to surface what a 2D view misses.

### Designed for Limited Hardware

A common barrier in medical imaging software is the hardware requirement. C2Three is built to run efficiently on **standard consumer hardware**, including devices with limited GPU resources. Advanced 3D visualization shouldn't require a radiology workstation.

## How the Reconstruction Works

Our algorithm approaches the scan the way the human body is actually structured:

1. **Ingestion** — Accept DICOM files
2. **Segmentation** — Identify and separate anatomical layers using trained models
3. **Volumetric Reconstruction** — Build a 3D mesh from the segmented layers
4. **Color Mapping** — Assign distinct colors to blood vessels, bones, muscle groups, and soft tissue
5. **Streaming Render** — Stream the model to the browser for interactive exploration

The result is a model where a hairline rib fracture — invisible in a single 2D slice — appears as a visible discontinuity in the 3D bone layer.
